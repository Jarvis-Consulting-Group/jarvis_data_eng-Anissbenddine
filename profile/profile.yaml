summary: "Hi, I am Aniss Benddine, a passionate software developer with a strong background in software engineering, geology, and spatial teledetection. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering, a Master's degree in Plate Tectonics and Spatial Teledetection, and a Bachelor's degree in Geology.I have gained valuable experience through various roles, including working as a Territory Manager for two years, an IT Technician for six months, and a Certified Computer Advisor for two years. Currently, I'm working as a software developer, where I have been able to apply my knowledge and skills to develop innovative software solutions. What I love most about computing is the challenge it brings. I've always been interested in tech since I was young, and I've always enjoyed the challenge of using technology to solve problems. I believe that technology can be used to create innovative solutions to some of the world's most pressing problems. Overall, I'm excited about the future of technology and the role I can play in shaping it. I look forward to continuing to learn and grow as a software developer and to use my skills and knowledge to make a positive impact."
